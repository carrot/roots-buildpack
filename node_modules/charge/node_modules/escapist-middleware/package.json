[Read this](http://markup.im/#q4_cRZ1Q) for more details.\n\n### Why should you care?\n\nSo you are serving a static site. You know, the usual. But you've got some files in your project you don't want to be publicly available. At the same time you don't want to have to remove them from your project. Escapist to the rescue!\n\n### Installation\n\n`npm install escapist-middleware`\n\n### Usage\n\nEscapist is pretty easy to use. You can feed it a string or array of string with paths to the files you'd like to prevent from being served. You can even use globstars, a la [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)! Quick example:\n\n```js\nvar http = require('http'),\n    connect = require('connect'),\n    escapist = require('escapist-middleware');\n\nvar app = connect()\n            .use(escapist('path/to/secret.txt'))\n            .use(connect.static('public'));\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(1111);\n```\n\nAlso, as noted, you can pass an array of string and use globstars, like this:\n\n```js\nescapist(['**/keys/id_rsa', 'plaintext_passwords/*'])\n```\n\n> **Note:** We do not endorse keeping ssh private keys and/or plaintext passwords in your repos.\n\nEscapist does not actually serve files, so it's not a standalone solution. It should be used as part of a larger stack.
